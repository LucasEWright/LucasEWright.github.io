		<p id="oneliner">There are hundreds of webpages for lovers of all things Mean Girls, but if you live for dozens of hilarious one-liners from the movie, <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/nico-lang/2013/02/40-mean-girls-quotes-that-make-everyday-life-worth-living/">this page</a> is for you.</p>
		<p>Not only does it provide the user with the quotes "that make everyday life worth living", it does it much clearer and cleaner than my page.  In particular I like the sectioning of primary content from the ads and other content, the use of multiple pages, and excess white space.  Experts like me don't need them, but it'd be nice if the designer would include the character they're quoting.</p>
